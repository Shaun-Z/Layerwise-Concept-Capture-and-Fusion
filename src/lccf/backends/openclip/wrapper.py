Description:
 - The wrapper accepts an already constructed open_clip model (e.g., via the model, preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms("ViT-B-32"). Then pass in model (or model.visual) and wrap)
 - If there is no preprocess, you can pass in tensor type inputs; if you give PIL.Image and there is no preprocess, it will report an error and give you a suggestion.
